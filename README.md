This project focuses on building a recipe page using HTML. 
It aims to showcase my ability to structure and style content 
with basic HTML elements, creating a clean and user-friendly layout for recipe presentation.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated a solid understanding of fundamental HTML concepts, including the use of headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links to create a cohesive and visually appealing webpage.
