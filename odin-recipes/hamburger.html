  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>

A homemade hamburger is a classic, hearty meal made by grilling or pan-searing a seasoned beef patty until it’s juicy and perfectly cooked. Nestled in a soft, toasted bun, the patty is often topped with melty cheese, fresh lettuce, ripe tomato slices, and a layer of pickles or onions for a satisfying crunch. A generous spread of condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayo brings all the flavors together, creating a delicious balance of savory, tangy, and fresh elements
  </p>

  <p>
    Ideal for family dinners, cookouts, or just a simple treat at home, a homemade hamburger is customizable to suit any taste. Whether you prefer a classic American cheese topping, a dash of spicy sauce, or adding avocado and bacon for extra richness, this burger is as versatile as it is comforting. It’s a delicious way to enjoy a timeless favorite with all the freshness and flavor of a home-cooked meal.

    <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is crumbled, browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Spoon off and discard any fat.</li>
    <li>Stir in tomato paste, ketchup, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, paprika, and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add beef broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni; reduce heat to medium, and gently boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 13 to 15 minutes. </li>
    <li>Remove from heat, and stir in Cheddar, ensuring cheese is fully melted and incorporated, 30 to 45 seconds. Let stand until thickened before serving, about 2 minutes.</li>
