  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Macaroni and cheese is a classic comfort food that combines tender pasta with a rich, velvety cheese sauce. The dish starts with macaroni cooked to perfection, then mixed with a creamy blend of melted cheddar and a smooth, buttery base. The cheese sauce coats each piece of pasta, creating a warm and satisfying texture that’s both hearty and indulgent.

  <p>
    Often served as a side or a main dish, macaroni and cheese can be enjoyed straight from the stovetop for a simple, homestyle flavor. For those who crave a bit of crunch, it can be baked with a topping of breadcrumbs until golden and crispy on top. It’s a versatile dish that brings comfort with every bite, perfect for a cozy night in or a family gathering.
